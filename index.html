<p>We believe art is essential to how people experience the world. Reinforcing the freedom of art making and itâ€™s propagation through new and existing audiences is the reason we exist. The Art*N Alliance (A*NA) builds and supports decentralised web software and initiatives, focusing on the agency of artists and their function at the apex of culture.</p>
